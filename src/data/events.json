      "longDescription": "Jab We Code is a unique programming contest that tests teamwork, adaptability, and strategic decision-making. Teams of two begin by solving separate contests (Contest A and Contest B) for 30 minutes before discussing their progress and swapping challenges. After another 30 minutes, they strategize once more before entering the final 20-minute phase, where both contests are open, and members decide who tackles which problem. The final ranking is determined by the combined scores of both contests. The top three teams win cash prizes.",
