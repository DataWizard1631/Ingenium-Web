      description: "Traditional credit evaluation methods often fail to capture the unique challenges and opportunities faced by farmers. Factors such as land quality, weather patterns, and crop yield potential play a significant role in determining a farmer's creditworthiness. Your challenge is to design an Alternative Credit Evaluation Tool that incorporates non-traditional data sources such as live GIS (Geographic Information System) data, upcoming weather forecasts, soil health metrics, etc., to create a more inclusive credit scoring system for farming loans. The tool should help financial institutions assess risk more accurately and enable farmers to access fair and tailored credit options.",
      KeyFeatures: [
        "Data Integration: Utilize live GIS data, weather forecasts, soil health metrics, and past crop yields.",
        "Financial Risk Assessment: Provide a transparent and explainable scoring system that financial institutions can trust.",
        "User Accessibility: Ensure the tool is usable by banks, NBFCs, and farmers with minimal technical knowledge.",
        "Scalability & Adaptability: Design the tool to work across different regions with diverse farming conditions.",

However, its adoption remains limited compared to traditional payment methods like UPI wallets and cash. Your challenge is to design a solution that streamlines the adoption and usage of this blockchain-based tender in everyday transactions. Consider addressing barriers such as user awareness, accessibility, integration with existing payment systems, and incentives for both consumers and merchants. Your solution should aim to make e-Rupee a more viable and widely accepted form of currency in India's digital economy.",
